# Docker_BudgetManagementApp

For developing a budget management app using Django, I just followed a tutorial and customised it to my needs and my requirements. 
The real purpose of this app was to understand how should I use Docker. So you should check : 
  - docker-compose.yml 
  - docker/python/Dockerfile
  - requirements.txt
   
For running the app, I used a Virtual Machine based on Linux. Main Verification Commands :
  - docker-compose up
  - docker images (to show images, their repository, tags and size)
  - docker container top (to display the running processes of a container)
